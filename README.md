## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

- **Flask Application:** A basic web app built with Flask.
- **Docker:** The application is containerized for consistent and portable deployment.
- **CI/CD:** Automated building and deployment using GitHub Actions.
- **Monitoring:** Real-time metrics collection with Prometheus and visualization with Grafana.

## Features

- Containerized Flask app for easy deployment.
- Automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- Integrated monitoring stack (Prometheus and Grafana).
- Scalable architecture suitable for cloud environments.

## Architecture

### High-Level Architecture Diagram

![Architecture Diagram](path_to_diagram) *(Optional: Include a diagram to visualize the architecture.)*

- **Flask App:** Handles HTTP requests and responses.
- **Docker:** Encapsulates the application in a container.
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Prometheus:** Scrapes metrics from the Flask app.
- **Grafana:** Visualizes metrics and logs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Optional: A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and a [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account for pushing images.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-app.git
cd flask-app
2. Build and Run the Docker Container
bash
Copy code
docker build -t flask-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-app
Visit http://localhost:5000/ to see the application in action.

3. Set Up Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
1. Ensure docker-compose.yml and prometheus.yml are properly configured.

2. Start the monitoring stack:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
3. Access the monitoring tools:

Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (Default login: admin / admin)
Usage
Access the Flask app: Visit http://localhost:5000/.
Monitor metrics: Check Prometheus and Grafana for real-time data.
CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions Workflow
This repository uses GitHub Actions to automate the Docker image build and push process.

The workflow file is located at .github/workflows/docker-image.yml and performs the following tasks:

Builds the Docker image.
Logs in to Docker Hub.
Pushes the image to Docker Hub.
To trigger the pipeline, push changes to the repository, and GitHub Actions will automatically execute the workflow.

Monitoring
Prometheus: Collects metrics from the Flask app, available at http://localhost:9090.
Grafana: Visualizes these metrics in a user-friendly way, accessible at http://localhost:3000.
